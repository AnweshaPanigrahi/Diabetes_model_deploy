# Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a web application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques. The application utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on a diabetes prediction dataset. Users can input various health parameters, including age, BMI, blood glucose level, and medical history (e.g., hypertension and heart disease), to receive a prediction of whether they are at risk for diabetes. 
The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and features a user-friendly interface where users can submit their health data. The model is loaded using `joblib`, allowing for efficient prediction in real-time. 

## Features
- User input form for health parameters
- Real-time diabetes risk prediction
- Simple and responsive design using Bootstrap
